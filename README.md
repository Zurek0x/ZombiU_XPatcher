# ZombiU_XPatcher
ZombiU X-Patcher is a patcher that includes "Bug Fixes, Crash Fixes, Hardware Support, Etc", We try our best to patch the game to the best we can through reverse-engenering, If you want to know why
we do this and put so much work into this its because we care about this game and what we see from ubisoft and how often they update this game it seems like they don't try or care enoguh like we do
so we are trying our best to fix the game to the best we can spending Hours/Days/Nights trying to figure out new ways to improve the game.
