# ZombiU_XPatcher
ZombiU X-Patcher is a patcher that includes "Bug Fixes, Crash Fixes, Hardware Support, Etc", We try our best to patch the game to the best we can through reverse-engenering, If you want to know why
we do this and put so much work into this its because we care about this game and what we see from ubisoft and how often they update this game it seems like they don't try or care enoguh like we do
so we are trying our best to fix the game to the best we can spending Hours/Days/Nights trying to figure out new ways to improve the game.

Due to the factor of Hex Editing and editing of the modules the memory has shiften a few KB' back and thus makes a lot of mods incompatible.

# How To Patch | USING LPM VERSION | COMPATIBILITY VERSION
```
LPM Version is a more Weightless version of the Release Build that uses less modules and required datasets and other stuff.
This removes a lot of the Overlay Functions and Functions that require C++ or DOTNET Capibility and is just the BASE moded game.

To install LPM instead of copying the files from the Version X.X folder copy it from (Version X.X [LPM]) Folder.
Installation is same.


The best use case is if you are running a older machine or another OS that doesn't support or have DOTNET or C++ for fancy features.


Reason Why We have LPM?
We are trying to add more fancy features like Overlays or Live Memory hacking and this all requires advanced programming features
Like DOTNET or C++, And we know that some people are gonna try to run this game on older hardware or older machines or another OS like Linux Or MAC
That don't have DOTNET or C++ Capability, So we include a LPM version that doesn't require DOTNET or C++ but you will lose all the fancy features


LPM DOES NOT AFFECT BUG FIXES, YOU WONT LOSE ANY BUG FIXES IF YOU USE LPM
```

# HOW TO RESTORE BACK TO ORIGINAL GAME
```
1a. If you have a saved backup then re-load that

Steam Launcher:
If you are on the Steam Launcher then in your games properties menu there should
be a option to Validate Game Files, You can use that to validate your game files

Ubisoft Launcher:
If you are on the Steam Launcher then in your games properties menu there should
be a option to Validate Game Files, You can use that to validate your game files
