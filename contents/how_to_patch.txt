How To Patch | USING LPM VERSION | COMPATIBILITY VERSION

LPM Version is a more Weightless version of the Release Build that uses less modules and required datasets and other stuff.
This removes a lot of the Overlay Functions and Functions that require C++ or DOTNET Capibility and is just the BASE moded game.

To install LPM instead of copying the files from the Version X.X folder copy it from (Version X.X [LPM]) Folder.
Installation is same.


The best use case is if you are running a older machine or another OS that doesn't support or have DOTNET or C++ for fancy features.


Reason Why We have LPM?
We are trying to add more fancy features like Overlays or Live Memory hacking and this all requires advanced programming features
Like DOTNET or C++, And we know that some people are gonna try to run this game on older hardware or older machines or another OS like Linux Or MAC
That don't have DOTNET or C++ Capability, So we include a LPM version that doesn't require DOTNET or C++ but you will lose all the fancy features


LPM DOES NOT AFFECT BUG FIXES, YOU WONT LOSE ANY BUG FIXES IF YOU USE LPM
